DEAN: Rosemary's Baby.
DEAN: Well, that's a great movie. You've got good taste. [silence] Are you moving?
DEAN: My family just moved here from Chicago.
DEAN: Yeah. Yeah, that's the place. I'm Dean.
DEAN: Rory.
DEAN: Lorelai. I like that.
DEAN: Well, I better go.
DEAN: I have to go look for a job.
DEAN: [turns back] What?
DEAN: I. . .I don't really dance much.
DEAN: Oh, great. Uh, thanks. Hey, what are you doing now?
DEAN: Well, maybe you could show me where this Miss Patty's place is.
DEAN: So, have you lived here all your life?
DEAN: Well, that's not far.
DEAN: Really?
DEAN: Okay, then.
DEAN: What?
DEAN: Okay, I'll remember that.
DEAN: So, how are you liking Moby Dick?
DEAN: Yeah?
DEAN: Cool.
DEAN: Uh, well, I've been watching you.
DEAN: I mean, not in a creepy, like, "I'm watching you" sort of way. I just -- I've noticed you.
DEAN: Yeah.
DEAN: Every day. After school you come out and you sit under that tree there and you read. Last week it was Madame Bovary. This week it's Moby Dick.
DEAN: Because you're nice to look at, and because you've got unbelievable concentration.
DEAN: Last Friday these two guys were tossing around a ball and one guy nailed the other right in the face. I mean, it was a mess, blood everywhere, the nurse came out, the place was in chaos, his girlfriend was all freaking out, and you just sat there and read. I mean, you never even looked up. I thought, "I have never seen anyone read so intensely before in my entire life. I have to meet that girl."
DEAN: Maybe, but I doubt it.
DEAN: Yeah, you did.
